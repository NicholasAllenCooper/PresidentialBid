# My Presidential Bid
I am announcing my big for the United States presidency. I will be running outside of the party influence, because I cannot, in good faith, attach my bid to either the GOP nor to the Democratic Party. Neither do I believe that I can attach my bid to either the Green Party, the Libertarian Party, nor any other minor party associated with the United States, and that will be why I will run as an Independent.

The run as an Independent will be a longshot run, as I am incapable of the kind of funding that the parties can muster, and will instead focus on using social media platforms to bolster my run. This moment, being a dangerous time to use social media with any expectation of good faith regarding those facts related to any political discussion, verification will become important, as facts will be misconstrued, misused, and will be exchanged for bold-faced lies.

So, I find it best to begin with a vision and mission for what political positions I hold, what I would like to see, and I would prioritize, assuming that it is possible for such things to happen.

The details regarding the changes I would advocate for are going to come, slow and plodding, as they are spelled out, analyzed, and criticized for effectiveness.
