Karl Marx produced various works of political philosophy. Much of it created a new idea for society from his works, but it rested on some major flaws. Some of those flaws where flawed thinking about humanity, but there were other assumptions that were nearly spot-on.

Those flawed assumptions include that:

* He assumed human beings are rational thinkers (which predates Marxism and is still something many economists are still having to slowly deal with). Human beings are not rational.
* Regarding centralization: He assumed that the computation of information management and control for an economy can be quick enough to be handled centrally. It is still unknown whether this will ever be the case, or whether this will slowly become the case. Distributed computation is faster than centralized computation, and deals with fewer hidden factors.
* Regarding equality: Because Marx predated Zipf (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law), he was unaware just how much single individuals, when put in the right position, can have enormous impacts in that single area. It is possible for the productivity of a single individual to outstrip all of those around them. The counter argument to Zipf’s Law is that is that productivity measures can miss important hidden variables (https://www.2civility.org/super-chickens-lesson-competition/) along the way that the “productive individual (https://www.apqc.org/blog/superchicken-management-model-hurting-your-productivity)” doesn’t see. However, there will always be some form of “class”.
* Because the “hidden dependency (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_dimensions_of_notations)” problem is such a problem, metrics have a difficult time measuring everything that’s necessary for productivity to happen, and therefore, the idea that we can be generally “meritocratic” with people will fall short. In fact, the entire argument about “value” in general is one that philosophers and psychologists are still trying to grapple with, but it’s obvious that his theory regarding value did not pan out.
* People build their lives based on expectation. Property is the expectation and security that I can go home to my toothbrush in my toothbrush holder in my bathroom, inside the home that I have placed the pink unicorn curtains which demonstrate my individuality. Expectation is an important part of morality, and therefore the “sin of owning property” is not a tractable problem to be resolved in our current state of affairs, and under the current human psychology. Furthermore, every recent attempt at communism has tried to address societal cohesion via coercion and conformity, ignoring individual expression and autonomy to get there. Perhaps that is an implementation flaw, but more likely it’s not.

However, he was right when it comes to several things:

* People who have stake in a company are more committed to the company.
* The racism, sexism, ethnocentricism, and every other alienating “-ism” that we deal with may exist on various surface levels, but each ultimately has “class warfare” all over them. **There are actual significant problems **that each of these groups deal with (problems that are different for each group); however, the significance of the problems still originate from elitism vs anti-elitism (even if misplaced against the wrong groups). This dichotomy has destabilized nations (people and societies) in general and has turned people against each other.
* Unregulated capitalism (exploitation) is unstable, and it’s also rife with encouraging factors hidden from the consumers. Also, crony capitalism is not capitalism.
* Shared risk (i.e. insurance, security) is best handled at a larger level. Risk is difficult for an economy, because risky behavior can give large payouts and large disruptions. There are risks that people take that often have high potential for failure and low potential for payout too, and if these risks are taken then everyone is affected in a large pool. So, shared risk is better, but only when people are considering ROI. This is the problem both sides are arguing with each other about regarding healthcare.
* We are not paid for our worth. There is a necessary gap between the value brought to a corporation and the money paid to the worker. If this were not the case, then there would be no profits. The question that will always be asked is whether the balance is fair.
* The point of philosophizing is to affect change (by promoting solutions).

Things that need refinement:

* The inequality of influence that typically leads Capitalism to Crony Capitalism is much the same that centralization of authority may (eventually) lead to someone who is self-serving to take the reins. It’s not corruption of power of any single person, but that power attracts self-serving individuals and generational effects lead to what people call corruption.
* It’s not the actual inequality of cash that bothers people as much as:
** Abject poverty is miserable, especially when one works multiple jobs and can’t feed themselves. It is a severe reduction of choices that the individual has.
** Poverty is a vicious cycle with generational effects, and intergenerational mobility (a measure of one’s autonomy) takes a beating with equality.
** People care strongly about **inequality of influence **(especially over their lives) and know that money is influence. The inequality of influence is also what riles up tensions between various groups.
* He’s right that human beings want to feel like they are productive members of society, but that doesn’t imply that they will seek a job to fulfill that need. There are several psychological issues, such as addiction, mental illness, depression, etc. that affect work. There exist issues with self-worth and where one fits in that may not fit with a diagnosis. Furthermore, the job that one really wants to do may not be a reasonable job.
* Short-term competition, not capitalism, destroys things that are not immediately seen as valuable in the short-run. There is little incentive to grow long-term when there are only interests in short-term gains. This moves into education as well, and critical thinking becomes replaced with memorization.

One serious problem is the issue of the commons. Distributed planning (capitalism) allows everyone to manage their own interests themselves, but it does not distribute influence such that it includes the environment (common environmental resources). In fact, the biggest problem that needs to be solved, and has always needed to be solved in any governmental system, is how to properly manage influence. It is not solved by capitalism, communism, socialism, monarchies, anarchies, oligarchies, etc. or anything that we have seen as of yet.
In effect we are still at the age where, “someone is going to get shafted” (i.e. interpretations of “fairness” will not necessarily match anyway) and therefore, revolutions and fights will continue until this problem is solved reasonably enough.
