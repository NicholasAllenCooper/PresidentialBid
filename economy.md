## Public Debt
It’s too much. It was too much when the Democrats were in power and too much when the Republicans were in power. It will be necessary that this be dealt with before debt-to-GDP. Including both mandatory and discretionary spending, the top 3 expenditures are: Health, Social Security, and Defense/Homeland Security.

Social Security is a stand-alone system that pays for itself, but we have been borrowing from the Social Security budget since Reagan.
It has already been demonstrated that small changes to tax rates can significantly affect the deficit, which has grown higher with increasing military

## Slow and Reversible Flat-Tax with Basic Income Guarantee
Firstly, hard-and-fast irreversible changes to the economy cause problems. Therefore, any change, at the magnitude that I’m proposing here, would necessarily have to be implemented slowly.
This is so much further down on the list as a priority, because this would effectively be an experiment run on the public, one that must be reversible if it demonstrates that it is the cause of making things worse. However, as is always the case with any policy, policy makers may lie about the causes, and may change implementation or the metrics.
So, it’s necessary that this be done as varying processes with the reins held over some variables and not others, so it CAN change, and the changes can made be predictable. The ultimate goal, assuming the years have played out, and the full implementation is completed, will be:
* A Basic Income which is parameterized by:
  * An acceptable disparity measure (such as the GINI coefficient and Intergenerational Mobility Index) that will increase the payout as inequality worsens, with the goal of maintaining a range for the measure used.
  *	An acceptable inflationary measure (such as CPI) that will increase the payout as inflation increases, which is supplemental to the inequality measure. This measure would be locationally-based on the cheapest living conditions in the nation. Any gaps would have to be picked up by: states, local cities and counties, volunteer organizations.
  * The amount of service that the individual has given, prioritized by military service, and then by volunteer service. More details will be spelled out at a later date.
  * The number of hours worked in that time period, time averaged over several months, attempting also to register more small businesses like child daycare and home education by the hours worked. Losing a job would mean that the Basic Income would begin to fall off as well, instead of becoming a sudden drop.
*	A flat tax, parameterized by:
  *	The state of the economy – It will decrease during recession, and increase during booms
  * The public debt – Increasing in taxation as the debt increases means that there will be a lag, since it is not tied to the deficit, but to the debt itself. The goal will be to get the tax level to set the public debt between 60% to 75% of GDP.
  * This also allows handling of emergency situations
*	Disability will become entirely separate from the process:
  * Employers will receive help to make workplaces assessable when necessary for an employee.
  * Citizens unable to work will not receive payments directly, but home-help, etc., will be paid for out of disability.
  * There will be no penalty for any work done while disabled, for any type of disability.
*	Changes to taxation:
  * All short-term consumables (≤ 2 yrs) and services will be tax deductible, and will also include rent and interest.
  * Capital Gains are taxed at the full rate, and Capital Losses are fully deductible.
  * All transfer of money prior to the taxation cutoff date is removed from the transferor as income and will be considered by the receiver as income.
  * Charities will be taxed on money that is neither used to pay workers nor for the consumables and distributions.
* Slowly, the following will be phased out:
  * Social Security will be entirely replaced with the Basic Income, but only over nearly 50 years as those that paid in are still entitled to the money paid. 
  * Employment insurance is removed.
  * Public Pensions and Thrift Savings Plans will be replaced with 401k with matching.
  * Minimum Wage will be phased out altogether, and hopefully, so will jobs that don’t pay well.
* Alternatives to Basic Income
  * Public housing, with a cafeteria, and a business center will be given as a choice to replace basic income for those that cannot maintain themselves due to disability and/or financial illiteracy.
  * Further details to the public housing will follow as it is spelled out.
* Requirements from the public:
  * Churches, community service, and volunteer agencies will still need to pick up some slack.
* Miscellaneous
  * Children will receive a Basic Income into a trust fund that they get later, to pay for college expenses or a first house.
