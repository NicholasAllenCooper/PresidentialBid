# Abstract
My claim is that people are not as interested in income inequality as they are about:
- Inequality of influence
- The misery of abject poverty

# What People Think of When They Talk about Inequality

# The Root Concerns of Inequality
People understand very well that there will always be people more skilled, more productive, more determine, and sometimes just plain more 
lucky or more willing to break the rules, and therefore will be more rich than others. Marx failed to account for Zipf's Law when it came 
to discussions about equality. 

On the other hand, it's not to claim that these rich people are somehow better people, because they have more money. The public understands
that money isn't everything, but there is a tendency to discuss things in terms of "deserving" and "undeserving" when it comes to money.

Trying to break down who deserves what immediately devolves into factions arguing things about people's lives which end up having no real
relevance to the situation. The fact is, people have a history of being notoriously bad at determining who deserves things, but we are 
often still attempting to make such judgements about people we have never met.

In some regards, this is necessary, in order to help deter crime and exploitation, especially when it is exceedingly obvious that 
exploitation has occurred.

For the most part, people are content with a little inequality, because they want to know that if they work hard that they will not just
survive, but that they will thrive instead.

The concern is still there. People are not only not thriving, many are abjectly miserable.

## Immiseration

## Inequality of Influence
To key in on the concerns that the public has, it pays to remember that they are people with their own concerns and that they want for
their concerns to be heard. Oftentimes the expectations from others exceed the potential, and that leads to disapointment in every that
such a mismatch occurs.

There has been so much talk over the years about power, hegemony, and sway, but it actually comes down to what people want more than
anything else: influece. Most people don't really want complete control over every aspect of their lives, and are willing to resort to
giving some control over to automata such as artificial intelligence, calculators, washing machines, safety systems in vehicles, and
other computerized and automatic things. We want the influence to decide how these things work in relation to us, but we'd rather not
do everything ourselves.

### What the Public Thinks When They Say "Elite"
To an average person, when they use the term "elite", the meaning is "someone with influence". It's not a term that means "rich" or
"skilled" to the average person the way the term means to most. Instead, the feeling conjured up is someone who can be heard.

Oftentimes, it seems as if people don't want to listen to the "elite" in their "ivory towers", but what they are actually claiming is
that "those with the influence are not listening to the concerns they have". The word "elite" has just become a perjorative for someone
who cannot understand the everyday issues that the person has to deal with.

On the other hand, no one can truly walk in each other's shoes, and so there are often things that the public doesn't get about the daily
lives of those they consider to be "influential".

However, this is why Californian's are considered "elite". This is why politicians are considered "elite". It's why academics, the media
personnel, and so on are considered "elite". The perception is that there is more influence on and over their lives.

### Representation

This is the purpose of the representative in a representative democratic republic such as our own. The representative is supposed to
take our concerns, read through and write the legalese of all of the future laws, and vote for those that are the best. The average
person then asks themselves, "but best for whom?".

In the public sphere, divorced from discussion of legal policy, the inequality of influence is also felt in numerous ways by various
people. If you are at all interested in why we are in our current standing, it's due to perceptions that are definitely not ungrounded:

- In terms of class:
  - The average worker perceives that the "elite" don't listen to them
  - The average middle-class to lower-class individual perceives that "money = influence" and that they have none

- In terms of demographics:
  - The average minority perceives less influence in their lives than members of the majority groups, and calls the influential anything 
    from: "the hegemony", "the patriarchy", and so they have started several movements:
    - Black-Lives Matter - because of perceived lack of influence in the justice system and in the relationships with police forces
    - #MeToo and #TimesUp - because of perceived lack of influence in the workplace and in the justice system
    
  - The average member of the majority group perceives influence as zero-sum, and that they are losing theirs, and has formed into the
    Alt-Right, and various other right-wing groups
    
- In terms of information:
  - The average person perceives that their concerns are not being reported (media-bias)
  - The average person perceives that their concerns are not being well-studied and described (anti-intellectualism, conspiracy,
    anti-academia, and anti-science)

Ultimately, people want representation, and they know that, if the squeaky wheel gets the oil, then it has turned into a squeek-match to
outspeak each other on every subject.
