= The Paradox of Representation

The paradox that most of us have regarding representation is that we want direct influence, but we don't want the direct responsibilities:

* We don't want to spend our whole lives reading and studying up on every single bill that is put up for a vote, study up on all of the legalese that will be used, write bills that suit us and then vote on those bills
* We want those representatives that we put in charge of these tasks to remember us as we go about our busy lives
