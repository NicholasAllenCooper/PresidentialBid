# Why Me?

The point of this page is to explain why I'm running. It's not about whether or not I deserve the position, because no one deserves such a position. It's only a matter of proposal. In the end, I am either elected or I'm not elected.





## Why Not?

As far as qualifications go, the minimum qualifications are met:

* I'm natural born
* I'm over 35
* I've lived in the United States of America my entire lifetime

Arguments from a lack of experience would be counterproductive as there are no individuals experienced in the role of President prior to becoming President. It is not a CEO position as government is not run, and cannot be run, like a business, and business and household analogies for government don't work. Despite being Commander in Chief, and despite doing logistics work, it's not just the position of a General because it is responsible for taking on the interests of all citizens.

In fact, I'd argue that the USA is looking for an individual who:

* has little interest in political optics -- which is who many thought the current President would be
* has experience as a typical working-class individual -- one who understands the struggles on the ground


# Necessary Roles of Presidency

The position of presidency and of executor is really manyfold:

* Logistician in Chief -- It becomes my responsibility to keep things flowing, promote efficiency, get things where they need to be, and as "Commander in Chief" much of military framework is built around logistics. Security decisions will need to be made, but these also fall under the framing of logistics with asset control.
* Preacher in Chief -- The "bully-pulpit", as it's called, is the pulpit of one who is easily heard. In the rough times ahead, one must always be willing to demonstrate the hope that comes from faith, while managing expectations. People build their lives around expectations, and expectations also factor into a person's ethical principles. It will be my charge to speak with integrity and honesty while offering the hope that comes from on high.
* Ambassador in Chief -- The position of the presidency is one of ambassador to all other nations. Recent actions have weakened our position of integrity throughout the world, and have demonstrated the differences between the fake-strength that comes from attempts at fear and bullying vs the true strength that comes from resolve and from working together. It would be my role to strengthen the bonds and work to create collaboration and compromise, not capitulation.
* Interviewer in Chief --
* Mediator in Chief --

As someone who is not beholden to either party, I am not chief of any particular party.
