# Why Me?

The point of this page is to explain why I'm running. It's not about whether or not I deserve the position, because no one deserves such a position. It's only a matter of proposal. In the end, I am either elected or I'm not elected.

# Acknowledged Roles of Presidency

The position of presidency and of executor is really manyfold:

* Logistician in Chief -- It becomes my responsibility to keep things flowing, promote efficiency, get things where they need to be, and as "Commander in Chief" much of military framework is built around logistics. Security decisions will need to be made, but these also fall under the framing of logistics with asset control.
* Preacher in Chief -- The "bully-pulpit", as it's called, is the pulpit of one who is easily heard. In the rough times ahead, one must always be willing to demonstrate the hope that comes from faith, while managing expectations. People build their lives around expectations, and expectations also factor into a person's ethical principles. It will be my charge to speak with integrity and honesty while offering the hope that comes from on high.
* Ambassador in Chief -- The position of the presidency is one of ambassador to all other nations. Recent actions have weakened our position of integrity throughout the world, and have demonstrated the differences between the fake-strength that comes from attempts at fear and bullying vs the true strength that comes from resolve and from working together. It would be my role to strengthen the bonds and work to create collaboration and compromise, not capitulation.

As someone who is not beholden to either party, I am not chief of any particular party.
